Interface between Amazon Echo and my [Home Assistant](https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant) instance

Based heavily on this Hello World demo project: https://github.com/zpriddy/ZP_EchoPy

This is, at least initially, a project for my own use and the inspiration of others, as it's currently heavily-tailored to my HomeAssistant implementation.
